Fake News Detection using Machine Learning<br>
In this machine learning project, we built a classifier model using the supervised machine learning algorithm to verify if the information is false (fake).

We applied the supervised Passive Aggressive Classifier algorithm in python fake news detection project and achieved 92% accuracy.
